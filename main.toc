\contentsline {paragraph}{ \normalfont Since long, electronic integrated circuits have dominated our modern technology. Now with the dawn of photonics, which is basically using integrated circuits made up using optics, it is not far that our modern technology takes a new toll and slide into a new generation of digital devices. Basically, Photonics is the technology of generating and harnessing light and other forms of radiant energy whose quantum unit is a photon. These can be used in multiple applications which not only include telecommunication and signal processing but also can be used from simple and biological sensing, to explore the vastness of the Universe, cure serious and unknown diseases and even help in forensics to solve difficult crime cases.}{viii}{chapter*.2}
\contentsline {paragraph}{\normalfont In this project, we have investigated the optical characteristics of coupled ring resonators whose media may either be active or passive. In case of a passive medium, intrinsic and coupling losses affect the circular transmission and dispersion of an input optical pulse. However, an active medium for a resonator is such a medium in which we use gain excitation to compensate for all the intrinsic losses of radiation inside the resonator while altering the spectral and dispersive properties of the ring resonator system. We demonstrated gain tunable optical analogs of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA). This allowed us to precisely control superluminal and subluminal group velocities of light in a coupled ring resonator system and enabled reversilbe transitions between them.}{viii}{chapter*.2}
\contentsline {paragraph}{\normalfont The optimized coupled resonators demonstrates continous variable of sub and super luminal group velocities and can be tuned owing to excitation of linear optical gain, and we can observe astounding spectral characteristics. These features of coupled resonators also allows to acquire control of transmission and photon storage times inside the optical cavity.}{viii}{chapter*.2}

\contentsline {paragraph}{ \normalfont In the name of Allah, who is the most beneficent and merciful. I would start off this extensive documentation with a quote from Carl Sagan, one of the greatest science educator ever, who created enough enthusiasm and curiosity in me to pursue my career in Physics. He said, \textit {"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known".} This is one of the reasons I chose to be a student of physics, it inspires me to search for the unknown clues that are hidden in the very fabric of reality. Physics gave mankind the power to dominate their world and use the best of nature for their benefit.}{ix}{section*.3}
\contentsline {subparagraph}{ \normalfont Since childhood, I had always been fascinated by computers and gadgets. Having the background of engineers in my family, I almost ended up joining computer engineering in High School. But the curiosity inside me had made me a stargazer. So I had questions about how do they get where they are, and what are they made of? These questions were those which made me switch my field to Physics which is a science of never-ending curiosity. In this process, a lot of people are included some directly and some indirectly, most of which is my family, because their never-ending support had made me chase my dreams.}{ix}{section*.3}
\contentsline {subparagraph}{ \normalfont So, to start off, I would personally like to thank my supervisor in this BS project, Dr. A. Naweed, whose outstanding supervision and guidance had helped me through thick and thin to complete this project and he also kept me motivated enough to continue my research in the field of photonics. I would like to thank my batch counselor Dr. A. H. Mujtaba, whose support and teachings made us all work harder and harder for the progression of science. Also, thanks to Ms. Zarqa for recommending me to Dr. Naweed. I would like to thank Dr. Seraj for motivating me and providing me help in computation related issues that I have encountered during this thesis. Also, I would like to thank all my peers and my batch mates of Fall 15, because the support and love I get from them are immeasurable. Special thanks to Bilawal, Khadija, Tayyab, Ali.

\contentsline {subparagraph}{\normalfont \relax \fontsize {14.4}{18}\selectfont On a basic level, there are so far two settled components of light control and direction inside the volume of an optical microresonator. The rest is the ordinary system of Total Internal Reflection (TIR) and the presence of evanescent waves, where the directing medium must be optically denser, i.e., have a higher refractive index, than the encompassing one so as to accomplish light constrained. The second is the photonic bandgap (PBG) found in artificial optical media having a spatial periodicity in one, two, or three measurements, named photonic crystals (PC), which is a consequence of the phenomenon of Bragg reflection causing the arrangement of frequency bands where propagation of light is restricted by the destructive interference of field harmonics inside the crystal. Exceptionally bound optical modes can be accomplished in these bands when certain deformities are presented in the generally flawless intermittent crystals. With PC defect modes, the light can be found in a size similar to its wavelength $(\lambda /n)$, where $\lambda $ is the vacuum wavelength and $n$ is the medium refractive index.[11]}{1}{chapter.1}
\contentsline {subparagraph}{\normalfont \relax \fontsize {14.4}{18}\selectfont These topics required a detailed study, which is what we are going to do in this Thesis. The scope of this thesis is not limited to the certain and most applicable type of optical resonator which is known as Whispering Gallery Resonators (WGR) [2], but we are going to extend this research on to different possible and quite promising arrangements and geometries of optical resonators known as Micro Ring Resonators (MRR) [5]. In Micro ring resonators we mainly focus on the ring-shaped optical wave-guides introducing coupling and different modes in a single and composite system of resonators. This will allow us to collectively measure and observe the combined effects of such resonators by studying their optical properties. Broad numerical and exploratory investigations have been committed towards the investigation of at least two coupled cavities, and a few significant applications have been illustrated, including upgraded spontaneous emission inferable from mode-density enhancement at the photonic band edge [16], enhancement of cavity quantum electrodynamics effects [17], realization of quantum-optical Josephson interferometer [18], parametric oscillations in a triple microcavity system [12], dual wavelength lasing [19], and realization of photodetectors for highperformance wavelength demultiplexing [14]. Coupling effects have been observed in detail and have made possible to observe effects like Electromagnetically Induced Transparency [20] and Electromagnetically Induced Absorption in coupled resonator systems which are called Coupled Resonator Induced Transparency and Coupled Resonator Induced Absorption [2].}{2}{chapter.1}
\contentsline {subparagraph}{\normalfont \relax \fontsize {14.4}{18}\selectfont This document is divided into different sections by compiling the work of 1 year long BS final year project. First, we will increase the understanding of the reader of what interferometers, resonators, optical resonators, and micro ring resonators are. Then, their underlying physics and relating phenomenons that are followed by the regimes of these optical systems and what outcome could be achieved by using these optical systems and their applications in photonics. Then we will focus on the systems that we used in this research process and their basic physical explanations. After that, I will show you the results of what I have collected by modeling these systems in different conditions (parameters). This extensive documentation will be useful for anyone trying to get started in this field of research because it is written in such a manner that a newbie in the field of photonics can easily grasp the ideas and can learn from it. }{3}{chapter.1}

\contentsline {subparagraph}{\normalfont \relax \fontsize {14.4}{18}\selectfont The resonance condition is fulfilled when the (compelling) circumference of the ring, or for the most part the round-trip length, is equivalent to a whole number numerous of the optical wavelength inside the medium. This means a progression of Lorentzian-molded transmission bends equally dispersed in recurrence by the FSR (Free Spectral Range), with the resonance linewidth portraying the capacity time of photons inside the cavity. The photon lifetime can be standardized to one optical cycle, known as the quality factor (${\mathcal Q}$), or the cavity round-trip time, known as the cavity Finesse (${\mathcal F}$). The most extreme reachable Q-factor is characterized as ${\mathcal Q_{int}}$, which is the intrinsic loss of the cavity such that, ${\mathcal Q_{int}} = 2\pi \tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}n/(\alpha _{i}\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em}\lambda _{res})$ [16] where $\alpha _{i}$ is the intrinsic loss coefficient and $\lambda _{res}$ is the free-space resonant wavelength. At the point when the resonator is coupled to the outer world, the Q-factor further decreases because of the loss imported by the coupler (${\mathcal Q_{ext}}$). This Q-factor, which defines mostly coupling and related external losses, can be given by ${\mathcal Q_{ext}} = (2n \pi L)/ {\lambda _{res}\tmspace +\thinmuskip {.1667em} T}$, where $L$ is the circumference of the resonator (in case of a ring), $\lambda _{res}$ is the resonant frequency, and $T$ is the transmitivity coefficient. Thus the total quality factor ${\mathcal Q_{load}}$ is comprised of these two parts: ${\mathcal Q_{load}^{-1}}$ = ${\mathcal Q_{int}^{-1}}$ + ${\mathcal Q_{ext}^{-1}}$.}{14}{subsection.2.1.4}

\contentsline {subparagraph}{\normalfont \relax \fontsize {14.4}{18}\selectfont The light is coupled inside the ring due to two sets of coupling approaches, one being lateral and other being vertical. These two approaches are necessary for the light from the optical waveguide to the couple inside the bent waveguide. The light stays, or resonates, inside the bent waveguide due to the effect of total internal reflection. Lateral coupling requires the same plane fabrication of waveguide and bent waveguide which are easier to fabricate. To ensure strong coupling, small separation is required between the waveguide and bent waveguide. Lateral configuration requires a single layer only but very accurate lithography and etching processes must be done to open up the gaps between straight and ring waveguides with high precision. In vertical coupling transport and bent, waveguides are etched in various layers. Vertical coupling expels the index contrast restriction of lateral coupling, additionally, it is an empowering innovation for the ring radii less than $ \approx 5 \mu m$. Another bit of leeway of the vertical arrangement is that the ring and waveguide layers don't need to be a similar thickness, which improves the design opportunity.}{17}{figure.2.5}
