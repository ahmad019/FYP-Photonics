\chapter*{{\Large Abstract}}
\paragraph{\normalfont Since long, electronic integrated circuits has dominated our modern technology. Now with the dawn of photonics, which is basically using integrated circuits made up using optics, it is not far that our modern technology takes a new toll and slide into a new generation of digital devices. Photonics is the technology of generating and harnessing light and other forms of radiant energy whose quantum unit is a photon.}  

\paragraph{\normalfont In this project, we have investigated the optical characteristics of coupled ring resonators, which may be either active (containing a gain element) or passive. In the case of passive coupled resonators, intrinsic and coupling losses affect the circulation, transmission, and dispersion of an input optical pulse. However, for active coupled resonators, gain excitation may be used to compensate for the losses. This alters the spectral and dispersive properties of the coupled-resonator system owing to the enhancement of the quality factor of the system. We demonstrated gain tunable all-optical analogs of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA). This allows us to precisely control the subluminal and superluminal group velocities of light pulses. Furthermore, we demonstrate the gain-mediated reversible transition between the sub and superluminal dispersion regimes.}

\paragraph{\normalfont The optimized coupled resonators enable continuous tuning of sub and superluminal group velocities. Furthermore, owing to gain manipulation, the transmission and light confinement duration may also be precisely tuned. These features make the coupled resonator system attractive for future applications in optical and quantum information science.}

\paragraph{ \normalfont In the name of Allah, who is the most beneficent and merciful. I would start off this extensive documentation with a quote from Carl Sagan, one of the greatest science educator ever, who created enough enthusiasm and curiosity in me to pursue my career in Physics. He said, \textit{"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known".} This is one of the reasons I chose to be a student of physics, it inspires me to search for the unknown clues that are hidden in the very fabric of reality. Physics gave mankind the power to dominate their world and use the best of nature for their benefit.}
\subparagraph{ \normalfont Since childhood, I had always been fascinated by computers and gadgets. Having the background of engineers in my family, I almost ended up joining computer engineering in High School. But the curiosity inside me had made me a stargazer. So I had questions about how do they get where they are, and what are they made of? These questions were those which made me switch my field to Physics which is a science of never-ending curiosity. In this process, a lot of people are included some directly and some indirectly, most of which is my family, because their never-ending support had made me chase my dreams.}
\subparagraph{ \normalfont So, to start off, I would personally like to thank my supervisor in this BS project, Dr. A. Naweed, whose outstanding supervision and guidance had helped me through thick and thin to complete this project and he also kept me motivated enough to continue my research in the field of photonics. I would like to thank my batch counselor Dr. A. H. Mujtaba, whose support and teachings made us all work harder and harder for the progression of science. Also, thanks to Ms. Zarqa for recommending me to Dr. Naweed. I would like to thank Dr. Seraj for motivating me and providing me help in computation related issues that I have encountered during this thesis. Also, I would like to thank all my peers and my batch mates of Fall 15, because the support and love I get from them are immeasurable. Then again I would like to thank my family and especially my mother, who never asked me about my grades and have always said, "if you love what you are studying, only then you can achieve true learning."}
\subparagraph*{ \normalfont	In the end, it is important to know that knowledge is a never-ending process, and Physics is such a beautiful field that every time I learn a new concept about the universe and its principles, it feels like I have been born again.}
