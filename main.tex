\chapter*{{\Large Abstract}}
\paragraph{ \normalfont In this project, we extended the research on optical ring resonators for such mediums in which there is gain. First we studied normally the optical properties of passive resonators and measured the effects of EIT and EIA in them (details later discussed). Then we moved over focus on active resonators varrying different parameters to acheive EIT and EIA in gain incorporating photonic resonators which have extensive amount of applications. The main focus for this project was to model the characteristics and properties of active resonators and compare it with the results of passive resonators. Due to the gain property of active resonators, similar effects can be seen here as in passive resonators but without losses involved. The main idea was to establish a photonic device that could work efficiently as passive resonators and also have more output.}

\paragraph{ \normalfont In the name of Allah, who is the most beneficient and merciful. I would start off this extensive documentation with a quote from Carl Sagan, one of the greatest science educator, who created enough enthusiasm and curiosity in me to persue my career in Physics. He said, \textit{"Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known".} This is one of the reason I chose to be a student of physics, it inspires me to search for the unknown clues that are hidden in the very fabric of reality. Physics gave mankind the power to dominate his world and to use the best of nature for his benefit.}
\subparagraph{ \normalfont Since childhood, I was more into computers. Then in High School, I almost made the decision of joining the computer engineer. But the scientist inside me made me a star gazer and curious about how they get where they are, and what are they made of? These questions were those which made me switch my field to Physics which is a science of never-ending curiosity. In this process, a lot of people are included some directly and some indirectly, most of which are my family because of their never-ending support had made me persue my dreams.}
\subparagraph{ \normalfont I would personally like to thank my supervisor in BS project, Dr. A. Naweed. Who helped me through thick and thin to complete this project and who kept me motivated enough to continue my research in field of photonics. I would like to thank my batch counselor Dr. A. H. Mujtaba, who's support and teachings made us all work harder and harder for the progression of science. Also there is a big role of Ms. Zarqa in my motivation for this project. She not only recomended me to Dr. Naweed, but she is also my mental health counselor when I am in dire need of help. I would like to thank my peers in this, because the support and love I get from them is unmeasureable. Then again I would like to thank my family and especially my mother, who never asked me about my GPA and anything and always said, "if you love what you are studying, only then you can get true learning."}
\subparagraph*{ \normalfont	In the end, it is important to know that Knowledge is a never ending process, and Physics is such a beautiful field that every time I learn a new concept about the universe, it feels like I have been born again.}
