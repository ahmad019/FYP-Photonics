We have demonstrated gain tunable optical analogs of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA). This allows us to precisely control sub and superluminal group velocities of light pulses that propagate through a coupled ring resonator system, which incorporates a linear gain element. \\

Furthermore, gain incorporating coupled resonators also enable reversible transitions between the sub and superluminal dispersion regimes. Additionally, we observed sub and superluminal light featuring all-optical EIT resonance, which in all previous studies based on passive coupled resonators, has been observed to yield only subluminal light. We also studied the spectral and dispersive properties of a cascade of three mutually coupled ring resonators. We have found a number of unique cascaded resonances, which display distinct spectral and dispersive behavior. The optimized coupled resonators demonstrate continuously tunable sub and superluminal group velocities owing to excitation of linear optical gain. These features of coupled resonators also allow enabling control of transmission and optical pulse storage times. Furthermore, cascades of ring resonators may be used to further enhance these characteristics.\\

Based on our study, we proposed and discussed new applications of coupled resonators. The findings reported in this thesis seem to be significant for the future optical and quantum communication systems.
