\section{Electromagnetically Induced Transparency}
Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) is a well-known phenomenon in atomic physics and its all-optical analog has generated tremendous interest in its physics. Basically, EIT is a transparency window in transmission and absorption spectrum. This narrow transparency window is the result of Fano-like interference among two transition pathways. There is another similar concept which is known as Autler-Townes Splitting (ATS) [1], which also shows a transparency window but it is the result of strong field-driven interactions in a two-level atomic system which causes the level to split [2].

EIT also enables us to hold control over the optical response of the medium. Basically, EIT is the result of having a strong connection between the light and the matter. Amplitudes of different pathways interfere due to quantum interference effects. These can be used in applications such as all-optical switching, slow light [8], optical sensing, light storage, and quantum information processing.

In photonics, EIT is said to be observed in plasmonic structures, photonic crystals, whispering gallery mode microcavities and coupled ring microresonators [5-8]. These devices can be summed up under one name, photonic devices and by seeing such effects we can say that we can get control of how information and energy travel through our device.

\subsection{EIT in Atoms}
A simple classical explanation for the EIT is as follows [2]. In the presence of light (electromagnetic field), the dipole inside the atom will start to oscillate due to the presence of the field. This dipole will oscillate with a certain amplitude and thus will re-emit radiation. If we introduce another field i.e light source which has the same amplitude but have a phase shift of $\pi$, then the combined effect of both the fields will cancel out. Thus then we can achieve a situation in which in spite of having an electromagnetic field, the dipole does not oscillate. Thus no radiation will be absorbed and the material becomes transparent. For EIT to occur, we must have a three-level atomic system, such as a lambda configuration, which is discussed below.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIT_3_level.eps}
\caption{A three-level system where level 3 splits due to the much stronger field of control laser.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Three Level Atoms}
A lambda-type three-level system is shown in Fig. 3.1. In this system, we will discuss what really happens quantum mechanically for the effect of EIT, without disrupting the essence of classical phenomenons. The probability amplitudes of level $\ket{3}$ are driven by two terms in the system. One is the probability amplitude of the ground state $\ket{1}$ and the other is the oppositely phased probability amplitude of the state $\ket{2}$. These both driving forces are opposite in signs but equal in magnitudes and have a frequency $\omega_{p}$ and are so balanced that probability amplitude of state $\ket{3}$ and the expected value of the amplitude of the sinusoidal motion at every frequency that has been applied is zero. 


One may ask how that opposite phase for a transition from the coherent states $\ket{1} \to \ket{2}$ along with the applied field $\omega_{c}$, makes absolute cancellation? Because we use the laser pulses that generate fast enough laser photons that the phase of transitions is maintained and is the correct phase for cancellation. 


\section{Coupled Resonator Induced Transparency \\ (CRIT)}
We can observe EIT-like properties in various types of coupled resonator systems. However, the scope of this thesis is limited to ring resonators systems only. The optical analog of EIT is referred to as Coupled Resonator Induced Transparency (CRIT). This kind of geometry (that we discussed in section 2.4) has been promising for a long time in the field of photonics. EIT can be observed in this system by mostly the explanation of classical wave travel.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{coupled_ring_EIT1.png}
\caption{Electromagnetically Induced Transparency observed in a 2 ring resonator system.}
\end{figure}


The traveling photon is coupled inside the first ring through the evanescent wave and travels inside the ring and acquires a phase shift equal to the round trip inside the optical cavity. When the light source and the phase shifted intracavity field matches so as that the constructive interference is amplified i.e their phases match perfectly, then at those frequencies there is a transparency window in the absorption spectrum i.e a narrow dip, or we see a sharp peak in the transmission spectrum [2].


Figure 3.2 displays the plot of transmitted intensity vs frequency detuning in a coupled resonator system (as shown in Fig. 2.16 in chapter 2). The parameters used here are couplings $r_{1} = 0.9$ and $r_{2} = 0.999$ and attenuations $a_{1} = 0.88$ and $a_{2} = 0.9999$ for first and second resonator respectively. Reproduced from the original work on \textit{"Coupled resonator induced transparency"} [2] from 2004.


Now let us look at the phase response of such a coupled resonator system. Figure 3.3 shows the effective phase of the system in red and shows the coupling phase, which is the phase between the two coupled rings, in yellow. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{coupled_ring_EIT1_phase.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{coupled_ring_EIT1_coupling.png}
\caption{Effective phase of the system in red and coupling phase shown in yellow vs frequency detuning.}
\end{figure}

Figure 3.4 shows the derivative of the phase of the system which gives us great information about the group index and group velocity of the system. 

This value is directly related to the group index of the system. From the graph, we can see that there are negative values for off resonances and positive values on resonances. This tells us that we have superluminal light off resonance and subluminal on resonance. 

\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{v_{g}} = \frac{n}{c} \frac{d\phi_{eff}}{d\omega}
\end{equation}

Where, group index and group velocity are related by, 
\begin{align*}
n_{g} = \frac{c}{v_{g}}
\end{align*}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=1]{coupled_ring_EIT1_deri.png}
\caption{Derivative of the transmitted phase of the system vs frequency detuning.}
\end{figure}

\section{Electromagnetically Induced Absorption}
In contrast to EIT, in Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA), constructive interference occurs between the transition probability amplitudes occurring across two transition pathways. This leads to a narrow dip in the center of the broader transmission dip in the spectrum of the system, known as Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA) shown in Fig. 3.5. As a whole, EIA is not a very well understood phenomenon and its explanation lacks the true essence.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{EIA_basic.eps}
\caption{Electromagnetically Induced Absorption in a coupled two ring resonator system known as Coupled Resonator Induced Absorption.}
\end{figure}

\section{Coupled Resonator Induced Absorption} 
 
Coupled resonator system as discussed above also displays EIA-like effect. The optical analog of EIA is known as Coupled Resonator Induced Absorption. CRIA can give us both fast light and slow light, most of the light leading to a different set of broad applications. The system discussed below is again a two ring resonator system as above and we will again follow the same procedure. Fig. 3.5 displays the CRIA in ring resonator system with coupling parameters as $r_{1} = 0.8998$ and $r_{2} = 0.9998$


\subsection{CRIT in a Passive System}
As before, now we are going to observe what changes does the system has when we introduce gain in it. For convenience, we will first see the passive results for a system and then introduce gain in either in second resonator or first resonator and then introducing gain in both of the resonators. This can be introduced by pumping some monochromatic light source or a laser, in either one of the rings which will drastically compensate the losses inside the resonator and will increase the overall output transmission of the system even above the incident light source. The system parameters are as follows, $r_{1} = 0.9889$ and $r_{2} = 0.9998$ with $Q_{1} = 1\times10^{5}$ and $Q_{2} = 1\times10^{6}$ for first and second resonator respectively (Fig. 3.6). 

\section{CRIT Results}
We observe EIT in a coupled two resonator system, the transmission and effective phase of the system is shown in Fig. 3.6 displaying normal dispersion meaning slow light in the system.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIT_1.eps}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIT_phase.eps}
\caption{CRIT with its effective phase in a passive resonator system.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Introducing Gain Only In Second Resonator}
Now we will activate gain in the second resonator, which has higher Q-factor (labeled 2 in Fig. 3.7). We increase the gain to compensate for the intrinsic losses, denoted by $\alpha_{i}$, which is directly related to the Q-factor of the resonator. The transmission peak of the EIT starts to rise up gradually as $g$, the gain coefficient, is increased. The peak rises towards 1 mark up till $g \to \alpha_{i}$, where alpha is the attenuation constant for intrinsic loss. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIT_gain2.eps}
\caption{CRIT in an active coupled resonator system.}
\end{figure}

When gain coefficient equals the intrinsic lost coefficient, i.e $g = \alpha_{i}$, the peak of the transmission touches the unity on the graph meaning now all of the incident light is verily being transmitted the other side i.e the medium has become completely transparent for resonant frequencies. This means that we have now compensated for all the losses inside the system which are intrinsic. When this happens, we see an abrupt change in the effective phase of the system. This system now gives us anomalous dispersion on-resonance meaning we get fast light in EIT (Fig. 3.8). 

To get a brief idea of what is really happening, I have also calculated the group index of the system. In this case, we receive negative values for the group index $n_{g}$ on resonance. Fig. 3.9 displays the group index for this particular case.


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{EIT_gain2_phase.eps}
\caption{Effective phase of CRIT in an active coupled resonator system. Magnified view of phase near resonance frequency is shown.}
\end{figure}

     
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{EIT_gain2_ng.eps}
\caption{Group index of an active resonator system showing negative values on resonant frequencies.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Introducing Gain Only In First Resonator}
Now we will activate gain in the first resonator (labeled 1), which has lower Q-factor in comparison to the second resonator. The spectrum of the EIT starts to rise up and displays a hanging EIT. (Fig. 3.10)

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{EIT_gain1.eps}
\caption{CRIT of the two resonator system with gain activated in resonantor 1.}
\end{figure}

The effective phase of the system remains the same as a passive resonator, displaying normal dispersion (slow light). The index value on resonance calculated to be about $\approx 76.2$ which shows that light has been slowed down only marginally for this case (Fig. 3.11). 

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIT_gain1_phase.png}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIT_gain1_ng.png}
\caption{Effective phase shows normal dispersion (in red) and group index $n_{g}$ shown in green.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Introducing Gain In Both Resonators}
Now we will activate gain in both of the resonators simultaneously such that the ratio of the gain coefficients, $g_{1}$ and $g_{2}$, are the same. We observe that the peak of the EIT, as well as the whole transmission, starts to rise up towards unity as $g \to \alpha_{i}$ (Fig. 3.12). The EIT transmission window also narrows down gradually.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.70]{EIT_gain12.eps}
\caption{Transmission graph of two resonator system with gain activated in both.}
\end{figure}

The effective phase of the system shows rather distinct curves which are basically due to the artifacts in the system or computation errors. The on-resonance information tells us that we have normal dispersion and positive group index about $\approx 766.5$ (Fig. 3.13). 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{EIT_gain12_phase.eps}
\caption{Phase and group index of a resonator system with gain in both resonators.}
\end{figure}

When the gain coefficient $g$ becomes greater than the intrinsic loss coefficient $\alpha_{i}$, then the whole transmission graph flips about the horizontal axis and we now see a distinct spectrum with a reversed EIT shown in Fig. 3.14.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{EIT_gain12b.eps}
\caption{Flipping of the EIT spectrum when gain coefficient is larger than the attenuation coefficient.}
\end{figure}

This flipping of the transmission does not affect the dispersion of the medium. This means the effective phase and the group index of the system are similar in this case. However, we now have a transmission peak which is above unity. This shows that due to gain, intrinsic losses have been compensated and a transparent coupled resonator system is achieved.


  

\section{CRIA Results}
Now we will observe the behavior of the transmission spectrum of CRIA when we introduce gain in it. Similarly, first we are going to activate gain in second resonator, then into the first resonator and in last we activate and increase gain in both resonators simultaneously. 

\subsection{CRIA With Slow Light}
We will first examine the response of the CRIA (Fig. 3.5) in a passive medium with having normal dispersion. shown in Fig. 3.15, with its group index.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{EIA_gain_phase1.eps}
\caption{Phase and group index of CRIA.}
\end{figure}
  
\subsection{Introducing Gain Only In Second Resonator}
Now we activate gain in the second resonator such that $g \leqslant \alpha_{i}$.  When the gain becomes closer to the value of $\alpha_{i}$ ($g \to \alpha_{i}$), the EIA spectrum changes into EIT type transmission (Fig. 3.16).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{EIA_to_EIT.eps}
\caption{CRIA dip changes from Fig. 3.5 into an CRIT type transmission when gain is introduced in second resonator.}
\end{figure}

The effective transmission phase changes from normal dispersion to anomalous dispersion. Corresponding group index displays a negative value of $n_{g} \approx -4505$ at resonance, implying a negative group delay and therefore, superluminal light (Fig. 3.17). Thus EIT which, in a passive coupled resonator system, always yields slow light, now enables superluminal (fast light) group velocities of resonant frequencies.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{EIA_to_EIT_phase.eps}
\caption{Phase of the system showing anomalous dispersion on resonance (zoomed) and group index showing negative values.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Introducing Gain Only In First Resonator}
Now we activate gain in the first resonator (labeled 1 in Fig. 3.18) and observes that the EIA resonance narrows down and eventually becomes a sharp transmission dip. Fig. 3.18. Corresponding transmission phase and group index reveal normal dispersion and slow light (Fig. 3.19).


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.30]{EIA_gain1.eps}
\caption{CRIA with gain activated in first resonator.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{EIA_gain1_phase.eps}
\caption{CRIA phase and group index.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Introducing Gain In Both Resonators}
Now we consider the case where the gain is activated in both of the resonators simultaneously. No notable changes occurs in the transmission spectrum when $g_{1}$ and $g_{2} < \alpha_{i}$. Fig. 3.20. The phase and group index is also shown in Fig. 3.21.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{EIA_gain12.eps}
\caption{CRIA with gain in both resonators.}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIA_gain12_phase.eps}
\caption{CRIA phase in red and group index in green.}
\end{figure}

However, if gain becomes closer to intrinsic loss, i.e $g \to \alpha_{i}$, the transmission spectrum values are very near to 1 now and we see anomalous dispersion in the effective phase of the system and negative group index of about $\approx -4550$ (see Fig.3.22).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIA_gain12b.eps}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{EIA_to_EIT_phase.eps}
\caption{Transmission rises towards unity, dispersion becomes anamolous on resonance, and group index displays negative values.}
\end{figure}

With further increase in the gain, the spectrum flips over the horizontal axis and EIA turns into an EIT like transmission Fig. 3.23. The dispersion remains anomalous as the gain is further increased, i.e $g > \alpha_{i}$. After the gain achieves a threshold value, again a transition occurs and anomalous dispersion is converted into normal dispersion (Fig. 3.24).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.40\textwidth]{EIA_gain12ab.eps}
\caption{Transmission of the system}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{EIA_gain_phase1.eps}
\caption{Phase and group index of the system.}
\end{figure}

It is worth noting that the EIT-like resonance shown in Fig. 3.23, usually gives slow light in passive resonators [8]. However, in the present case, fast light is obtained owing to the incorporation of a gain element into the system until a specific threshold gain value.

\subsection{CRIA With Fast Light}
Now we will consider a case featuring CRIA which leads to fast light in a passive coupled resonator system and studies the behavior when the gain is introduced in either one of the resonators. The coupling parameters are given as, $r_{1} = 0.8998$ and $r_{2} = 0.99998$ while the quality factors remains the same. (Fig. 3.25)

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{EIAf_passive.eps}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{EIAf_passive_phase.eps}
\caption{CRIA observed in a passive two resonator system with anamolous dispersion and negative group index.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Introducing Gain Only In Second Resonator}
Now we activate gain in the second resonator, shown in the schematic (Fig. 3.26), and observes that the EIA resonance narrows down and becomes sharp. While the amplitude of the narrow CRIA feature decreases, resulting in higher transmission. 

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[scale=0.65]{EIAf_gain2.eps}
\caption{Transmission spectrum of CRIA with gain in second resonator.}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{EIAf_gain2_phase.eps}
\caption{Transition from fast to slow light in CRIA.}
\end{figure}

The dispersion of the system changes as gain becomes close to intrinsic loss ($g \approx \alpha_{i}$) and normal dispersion and a positive group index are obtained (Fig. 3.27).

However, when the gain is further increased and it exceeds the intrinsic losses, such that $g > \alpha_{i}$, the spectrum then shows a conversion from CRIA into CRIT (Fig. 3.28) with normal dispersion and positive group index.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{EIAf_gain2a.eps}
\caption{Transmission dip transforming into an tranmission peak.}
\end{figure}

However, the dispersion of the system remains unaffected. It is worth noting that although the dispersion remains subluminal for higher transmission, the transmitted light becomes transparent due to CRIT resonance.

\subsection{Introducing Gain Only In First Resonator}
We again start with the passive CRIA of Fig 3.25. However, now we introduce gain in the first resonator only. We observe the CRIA resonance narrows down and becomes a sharp dip. Also, two off-resonances peaks appear in the spectrum. As $g \approx \alpha_{i}$, the resonance becomes further narrower and the system moves towards critical coupling. We still see fast light and negative group index from here but most of the light is absorbed. The transmission spectrum in Fig. 3.29 is shown for $g > \alpha_{i}$.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{EIAf_gain1.eps}
\caption{Transmission dip of CRIA with gain in first resonator.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Introducing Gain In Both Resonator}
If we introduce gain in both of the resonators of an initially passive system (Fig. 3.25), simultaneously, we observe the narrowing of CRIA dip and rise of the transmission towards unity. However, the transmission dip changes into a peak when the gain is greater than intrinsic losses ($g > \alpha_{i}$) owing to the transparency of the system (Fig. 3.30). The CRIT resonance of this transparent system leads to normal dispersion and positive group index of $\approx 2\times10^{4}$ (Fig.3.31).

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{EIAf_gain12.eps}
\caption{Transmission dip transforming into a tranmission peak.}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.60]{EIAf_gain2_phase.eps}
\caption{Respective phase and group index of the system.}
\end{figure}

These observations lead to the conclusion that when we introduce gain into the system, with it being activated in either one of the resonators or both, we observe drastic changes in the transmission and phase spectrums thus affecting the group delay and dispersion of the system. This allowed achieving gain-assisted tunability of the dispersion of the system, meaning the transitions between fast and slow light can be controlled by simply introducing gain into a passive coupled resonator system.


\section{Proposed Applications}
\subsection{Gain-controlled Optical Pulse Storage and On-demand Retrieval}
Coupling parameter between the resonators $r_{2}$, which is the internal coupling of the two rings, can induce very distinct changes into the system.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{photon_storage.png}
\caption{Single resonance displayed in a coupled resonator system with its transmission phase.}
\end{figure}

Now we will discuss a case in which the coupling between the first and the second resonator is very weak and the resonance of the second resonator is almost zero. Meaning we have a single resonance transmission at critically coupled i.e all of the light is absorbed. Fig. 3.32 displays the transmission spectrum along with its phase displaying anomalous dispersion. 

Now we will excite gain into the second resonator such that the gain coefficient $g_{2}$, is equal to the intrinsic loss coefficient $\alpha_{i}$. We observe a transmission EIT peak of 100 percent intensity meaning now we have the light pulse storage achieved via gain tuning. This process happens at nanoseconds scale meaning we can switch from zero to maximum intensity in nanoscale durations. Fig. 3.33 displays the gain excited transmission with normal dispersion meaning we have slow light which was the main ambition.

Thus the light pulse is stored inside the coupled resonator system and to retrieve the stored pulse back, we just simply need to excite gain into the second resonator of the system. The true shape of the input signal is not disturbed and the narrow peak of EIT shows us that very narrow bandwidth of frequencies can be stored.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.50\textwidth]{photon_storage_gain.png}
\caption{EIT peak emerged when gain is excited in second resonator in a coupled resonator system with its transmission phase.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Gain Controlled Slow and Fast Light Tuning}
We have observed from these results that the transitions from super and subluminal velocities of light have been in the control of the optical gain of the system. We have observed superluminal regimes of transmission reverting into subluminal transmission by the excitation of gain inside either one or both of the coupled two resonator system. Also, the subluminal transmissions such as EIT which always displays slow light in passive systems provided us with fast light and anomalous dispersion in the presence of gain in either of the resonators. This tuning of gain made possible the transitions between fast and slow light in both ways, meaning we have achieved control over how and when do we want fast and slow light for our device.

\newpage
\section{Discussion}
We exhibit increased tunability of optical analogs of Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) and Electromagnetically Induced Absorption (EIA). This enabled us to unequivocally control superluminal and subluminal group velocities of light in a coupled ring resonator framework, with a direct increase excitation and empowered reversible advances between them. Besides, we watched sub and superluminal light including all-optical EIT reverberation, which in every single past examination, in view of inactive coupled ring resonators, has been seen to yield just subluminal light.
